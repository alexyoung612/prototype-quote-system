# Background
This project is a prototype of an idea for an automated quote system for an awning/screen manufacturing company. The project intention is to provide a platform for an employee of the company (usually a sales person) to enter the many details of a potential screen/awning project for a customer, and to have that data be available for the manufacturing team, as well as send a friendly email to the customer with the basic details and price quote.

I wrote this as a green-as-grass junior developer roughly three years before adding to github, using basic PHP with jQuery and Bootstrap. I made this repo simply to store the original code for the (now named) Quotera prototype for posterity. I didn't use git when I started. As a result, there is only a single commit of the code for storage on GitHub. The only change I've made from the original is to remove sensitive data and information.
